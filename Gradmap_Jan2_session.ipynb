    "# EM counterpart to Gravitational waves\n",
    "\n",
    "Leo has covered a substantial ground on the recent discovery of neutron star - neutron star merger leading to scrambling of more than fifty obsrvatories to follow-up the electromagnetic counterpart from gamma-rays to radio waves. In this project, we will make use of the optical and near-IR light curves of this kilonova and fit a model to it to determine the time evolution of various parameters of the ejecta such as temperature, velocity and radius. We will use an expanding blackbody model in this project. \n",
